  At the end of every year, most Northwestern students change residencies. Freshman move out of dorms, sophomores move out of Greek housing, and juniors and seniors switch apartments or move away from Evanston all together. In this annual movement, one of the most overlooked and environmentally significant processes is disposal of items that occupants do not intend to bring to their next living space.

  These items can include large sets of furniture, bed frames, desks, tables, lighting fixtures, chairs, TVs, TV stands and other apartment furnishings. Likewise, these items can include day-to-day items like cleaning equipment, textbooks, binders, pens, notebooks, pots, pans, plates, and other household necessities.

  Most student try to recycle where convenient and, at worst, try to follow the school and cityâ€™s guidelines about how to discard of their various items. Yet, with so many students and so large a variety of items that are thrown out, we are convinced that there must be a more effective and environmentally sustainable method of moving. This project is a tool to directly address, educate, and improve upon this issue
